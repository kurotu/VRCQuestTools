# VQT Fallback Avatar

When the performance rank on Mobile (Android or iOS) is Good or better, VRCQuestTools automatically enables the avatar to be used as a fallback avatar after upload.

## Behavior

- When this component is present, the performance rank is calculated during upload
- If the performance requirements are not met, a warning will be output to the Unity console
- PC uploads are not processed
- If the avatar is already set as a fallback, no changes are made
