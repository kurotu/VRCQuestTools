# uloop focus-window

Bring Unity Editor window to front using OS-level commands.

## Usage

```bash
uloop focus-window
```

## Parameters

None.

## Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--project-path <path>` | Target a specific Unity project (mutually exclusive with `--port`). Path resolution follows the same rules as `cd` — absolute paths are used as-is, relative paths are resolved from cwd. |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Specify Unity TCP port directly (mutually exclusive with `--project-path`). |

## Examples

```bash
# Focus Unity Editor
uloop focus-window
```

## Output

Returns JSON confirming the window was focused.

## Notes

- **Works even when Unity is busy** (compiling, domain reload, etc.)
- Uses OS-level commands (osascript on macOS, PowerShell on Windows)
- Useful before `uloop capture-unity-window` to ensure the target window is visible
- Brings the main Unity Editor window to the foreground
